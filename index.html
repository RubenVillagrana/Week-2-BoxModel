    <h1>Box Model Week 2</h1>
    <p class="style1">In week 2 I will be practicing how to use the CSS box model to position 
        elements on a page. This class is really pushing me out of my comfort zone.
        I'm learning how to stay comfortable being uncomfortable. The last time I really felt this way 
        was joining the United States Army right out of highschool from Avenal California. </p>
    
        <p class="style1">I went from the central valley to South Benning Georgia. Saying it was a culture shock would be an 
        understatement. I had never left home or the state of California for that matter. I had never been 
        in a training environment and homesick. With all these challenges I knew I was going to be ok, the reason
        being is because I've never in my life quit or thought about quitting anything I have ever started.</p>
